abstract = "Abstract The rapid popularization of smartphones has   
contributed to the growth of online Instant Messaging and \{SMS\}  
usage as an alternative way of communication. The increasing       
number of users, along with the trust they inherently have in      
their devices, makes such messages a propitious environment for    
spammers. In fact, reports clearly indicate that volume of spam    
over Instant Messaging and \{SMS\} is dramatically increasing      
year by year. It represents a challenging problem for traditional  
filtering methods nowadays, since such messages are usually        
fairly short and normally rife with slangs, idioms, symbols and    
acronyms that make even tokenization a difficult task. In this
scenario, this paper proposes and then evaluates a method to       
normalize and expand original short and messy text messages in     
order to acquire better attributes and enhance the classification  
performance. The proposed text processing approach is based on     
lexicographic and semantic dictionaries along with                 
state-of-the-art techniques for semantic analysis and context      
detection. This technique is used to normalize terms and create    
new attributes in order to change and expand original text         
samples aiming to alleviate factors that can degrade the           
algorithms performance, such as redundancies and inconsistencies.  
We have evaluated our approach with a public, real and             
non-encoded data-set along with several established machine        
learning methods. Our experiments were diligently designed to      
ensure statistically sound results which indicate that the         
proposed text processing techniques can in fact enhance Instant    
Messaging and \{SMS\} spam filtering."
